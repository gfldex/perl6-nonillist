# NoNilList

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gfldex/perl6-nonillist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gfldex/perl6-nonillist)

Warn or fail when turning Nil into a list.

## MOTIVATION

Nil can pop up in many places where one might not expect it. This is usually 
fine. It can become problematic when it is turned into a list.

```
sub niler { }

my @a = niler();
say so @a.elems == 1; # True

@a := niler.list;
say so @a.elems == 1; # True

for niler() {
    say 1; # 1
}
```

Here we turn the absense of a value into a list with one element.

## USAGE

`use NoNilList::Fatal;`

This will die on `Nil.list`.

`use NoNilList::Warnings;`

This will warn and return `Empty` on `Nil.list`.
